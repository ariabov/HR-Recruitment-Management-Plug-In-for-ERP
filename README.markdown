### What:

This application is designed to showcase how company can manage perspective employees, speed up employee reimbursement process, and relate this to their budgets using their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system such as SAP or PeopleSoft.

### Why I Wrote This:

After working on my own tech startup as a developer for about a year, I knew I wanted to apply my skills to show how I can solve a problem. As a result, the application was written for my [senior project](http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/imesp/85/) in college about 9 months ago. When I was working in IT for a company that was undergoing massive SAP implementation, they lost a lot of important functionality for specific business units. HR lost ability to track their perspective employees. I saw the problem and decided to create the prototype application to emulate how 3rd party addon can cover the gap in functionality of ERP system. Due to difficulty of accessing real SAP database, I limited the scope of the project to using mock up db tables instead of actual financial tables in SAP/PeopleSoft database.

### Why I Am Proud:

I am proud of this code because it gave me the opportunity to show how I can create a solution to solve a real problem. And, more importantly, it was my first solo start-to-finish development project (as opposed to being a part of the team).
